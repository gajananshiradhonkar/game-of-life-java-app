step1:make parrent directory

  ~]# mkdir -p /data/build-tools
  ~]# cd /data/build-tools
  build-tools~]#  

 and download: https://dlcdn.apache.org/maven/maven-3/3.8.7/binaries/apache-maven-3.8.7-bin.zip
 or
maven software tar.gz file of 
maven by wget url and unzip  in it,


step2: now install java  verion 1.8.0  and chech by java -version.

step3:after clone of git files maven should run on every place so
by using envirmental varible we set the path of that maven.

step4: go to root user and  open hidden folder  .bash-profile file in root folder by vi editor and
edit that  and set ur maven path: 

# sudo su 
# ls -ltra
# vi .bash-profile
PATH=$PATH:$HOME /bin
export MAVEN_HOME=/gaju/buildtool/apache-maven-3.8.6
export PATH=$MAVEN_HOME/bin:$PATH
export PATH

~]# echo PATH ---------------TO CHEAK SETPATH

step5:logout sudo su - and check with mvn command
~]# mvn
~]# ls -ltra
~]# cd .m2/
~]# ls -ltr
]# cd reposioery/

step6: here .m2 folder is local repositaory of maven  and to check the dependency file or edit depenency file(if u want to make some changes in conf file)
we have to go to apache folder and then conf directory and then vi setting.xml file 
~]# cd /data/build-tools/
build-tools] cd apache-maven-3.8.6/
#] cd conf/
#cat setting.xml 
 
step7: now install git in root user and make one folder and clone git remote repo in that folder
]# cd ../.
]# cd .m2/
]# cd repositoery/
 
install git 
go to build-tools folder and mkdir myproject and clone git project game-of-life in myproject folder

myproject]# cd game-of-life 

step 8: now run the command  in that repo/ folder mvn clean package  to automatically build,test and download plugins and dependency file  from central repo of apache maven
and to get .war file through that.
 
game-of-life]# mvn clean package

step9: install maven by yum install maven in that repofolder/
 
step9: check that war file in gameof=life/target/gameoflife.war file here i.e in web folder of clone repository
]# data/myproject/game-of-life/gameoflife-web/target

step10: make a new folder server for install apache tomcat in it. by wget url-zip.file of tomcat and then unzip it.
]# cd data/
data]# mkdir server
]# cd server /

step11: now copy that .war file in webapps folder of tomacat directory by command 
cp -r file.war  /pathofwebapps folder     ex: cp -r gameoflife.war /data/buildtool/apache-tomcat 9.0.70/webapps

step12: go to tomacat/ folder thrn bin/ folder then start  tomcat service but first give permission to tomcat by 
command : chmod -R 744 apache-tomcat-9.0.70 then go to bin/ run command ./startup.sh

step13:now broswe the public ip address by ip.8080/folder name were deploy file is store ex: 10.10.2.255:8080/gameoflife

step14:  if we want to change the port number go to apache tomcat/ cd conf/  then vi server.xml  and change here.
